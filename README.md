## VM with Jenkins server and registred agent

Brief description of this project:

1. Instal VM by Vagrant.
2. Deploy VM server by ansible playbooks using Vagrant.
    - Packages updating
    - Python 3 installation (/usr/local/bin/python/bin/python3.11)
    - Docker installation and change default network to 10.0.0.1
    - Jenkins server deployment (manual setup)
3. Run registered jenkins agent by ansible playbook.

### Vagrant 

Clone repo.

You can change VM settings in config file `Vagrantfile` for example NET_CARD_NAME `config.vm.network "public_network" , bridge: "NET_CARD_NAME"`

To start and stop VM run commands in shell:

```
# Start VM 
$ vagrant up

# Kill VM 
$ vagrant destroy

# Run ansible provision
$ vagrant provision

# SSH login to VM
$ vagrant ssh
```

### Jenkins

```
$ vagrant ssh -c "/home/vagrant/jenkins_init_pass.sh"
```

Put initial password it on page  http://localhost:8080/

Please add user test:test. You can update Jenkins using web page and press restart option.

If Jenkins in container didn`t restart propertly  you can manualy start jenkins by run command:

```
./provisioning/files/vg_run_jenkins_agent.sh
```

You can check agent status on http://localhost:8080/computer/bullseye/
